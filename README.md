# Getting data from GE Proficy Historian using Proficy.Historian.ClientAccess.API
Proficy Historian is SCADA data store from General Electric. This small C# example is created to query the BAD tags from the Historian. The code is part of a project for maintaining MES tags in the system.

Please note: This is a rough-and-ready example code from my project @ BorsodChem.
